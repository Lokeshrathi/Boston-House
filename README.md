# Boston-House
We have taken a dataset for Boston Housing where we will find out how does lstat(lower status of population) vs the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s.

# How
I have applied ML algorithm (Linear Regression) to find out the same.

# Result
We saw a decrease in the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s with the rise of lstat and hence modelled the algo which finds the median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s for differenct percentage of lstat.
